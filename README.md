creepersIArena.Java is a paper plugin implementation of the original _Creeper's Imagination Arena_ datapack, introducing
more manageable, configurable, and accessible gameplay experience.

> [!WARNING]
> creepersIArena is still under development, means some behaviour, feature, or configuration may be unstable. In
> addition, this project is intended to works with our own server currently.

## Gameplay

WIP

## Management

WIP

## Quick Start

1. Download the plugin.
2. Place the plugin under your paper server's `\plugin` directory.
3. Start your server to generate configuration for the plugin.
4. Shutdown your server now, and edit the configuration files to adapt your own requirement.
5. Restart the server and enjoy.

## Extension

Extension feature is under planning. This will allow you to code some custom feature like extra jobs etc.

## Wikipedia

We may create a wiki introducing how to configure the plugin.

## Feedback

We use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.

When reporting a bug, include your Paper version, your Minecraft version, the creepersIArena version, your configuration
files, and
the relevant console logs so the issue can be reproduced.

Feature proposing may be slow to respond. We may not have enough time and patient to implement some feature, but we
still welcome you to tell us what can be added or improved.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and keep changes focused and easy to review.  
When opening a Pull Request, explain what changed, why it changed, and how to test it.

You also need to follow certain commit and Pull Request rules. We use
the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) for commits and Pull Requests naming.
